// Objectives
// Practice iterating through an array of objects/dictionaries.
// Imagine that you are given an array of objects.  For example,
var users = [
    {
        name: "Michael",
        age: 37
    },
    {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    },
    {
        name: "David",
        age: 27
    }
];
// How would you print/log John's age?
// How would you print/log the name of the first object?
// How would you print/log the name and age of each user using a for loop? Your output should look something like this
// Michael - 37
// John - 30
// David - 27

for (let x in users) {
    console.log(users[x].name + " - " + users[x].age);
}
